# Overview

EasyMiner是基于我们前期开发的[Easy353](https://github.com/plant720/Easy353)和[GeneMiner](https://github.com/sculab/GeneMiner)，在Windows上设计的增强版本。EasyMiner具有用户友好的Windows图形界面，可在个人电脑上高效准确地进行分子标记提取，无需依赖服务器。EasyMiner通过特别设计的拼接算法，能基于近源物种的参考基因从二代测序中快速准确的提取分子标记，并同时兼具细胞器基因组组装、gnebank文件中基因序列分解、二代测序文件导出等功能。

EasyMiner is an enhanced version of our previous developments [Easy353](https://github.com/plant720/Easy353) and [GeneMiner](https://github.com/sculab/GeneMiner), running on Windows. EasyMiner features a user-friendly Windows graphical interface for efficient and accurate extraction of molecular markers on personal computers, without the need for a server. By using specially designed stitching algorithms, EasyMiner can quickly and accurately extract molecular markers from second-generation sequencing based on reference genes from closely related species, while also providing functions for cell organelle genome assembly, gene sequence decomposition in gnebank files, and export of second-generation sequencing files.
